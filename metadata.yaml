description: A train of wagons and men wound slowly over the hills in the darkness
  and rain toward the South. In the wagons lay fourteen or fifteen thousand wounded
  soldiers, but they made little noise, as the wheels sank suddenly in the mud or
  bumped over stones. Although the vast majority of them were young, boys or not much
  more, they had learned to be masters of themselves, and they suffered in silence,
  save when some one, lost in fever, uttered a groan. But the chief sound was a blended
  note made by the turning of wheels, and the hoofs of horses sinking in the soft
  earth. The officers gave but few orders, and the cavalrymen who rode on either flank
  looked solicitously into the wagons now and then to see how their wounded friends
  fared, though they seldom spoke. The darkness they did not mind, because they were
  used to it, and the rain and the coolness were a relief, after three days of the
  fiercest battle the American continent had ever known, fought in the hottest days
  that the troops could recall. Thus Lee's army drew its long length from the fatal
  field of Gettysburg, although his valiant brigades did not yet know that the clump
  of trees upon Cemetery Hill had marked the high tide of the Confederacy.
